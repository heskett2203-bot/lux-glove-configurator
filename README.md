LUX Glove Configurator - Demo
------------------------------

This is a ready-to-upload demo project (dark mode) for the LUX Glove Co. custom glove configurator.

How to run locally:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- The project uses a procedural mock glove so it works out-of-the-box without a GLB file.
- Replace procedural model with your GLB and adjust mesh names as needed.
- To deploy: upload the project to StackBlitz, Vercel, or Netlify.
